::::Color Blender and Color Picker::::
Color Blender and Picker are two companion apps that were created for the Mobile App Development course for Spring of 2019 semester.  Color Picker allows the user to determine a specific color, and can be accessed from Color Blender. Color Blender allows the user to choose two colors and blend them to form one color, using a slider to determine the intensity of each color.

::::Step and Stair Counter::::
Step and Stair Counter is an in-class developed app, which went above and beyond the expectations of the assignment.  It uses the phone's sensors to attempt to determine the number of steps a user takes, or can be switched to "Stair Mode" to attempt to accurately determine the number of steps a user took up or down a staircase. The user can look at a report of their most recent trip.  

::::FlashBeepShake::::
FlashBeepShake is another in-class developed app, in order to demonstrate the usage of the phone's flashlight, speakers and vibration functionality.  The user can press a button to activate each of the features; it is a fairly basic app.
