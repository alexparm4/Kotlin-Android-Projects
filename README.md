::::Color Blender and Color Picker::::
Color Blender and Picker are two companion apps that were created for the Mobile App Development course for Spring of 2019 semester.  Color Picker allows the user to determine a specific color, and can be accessed from Color Blender. Color Blender allows the user to choose two colors and blend them to form one color, using a slider to determine the intensity of each color.
